= Logging information about integration execution
:context: log

For each execution of an integration, 
for each step in a flow, {prodname} provides the following activity 
information:

* The date and time that the step was executed
* How long it took to execute the step
* Whether execution was successful
* The error message if execution was not successful

To view this information in {prodname}, display the integration's summary
and then click the *Activity* tab. 

To obtain further details about integration execution, you can 
log information about the messages that an integration processes by 
adding a log step and/or a log connection to an integration flow. 

The following topics provide details:

* xref:comparison-log-step-connection_{context}[]
* xref:add-log-step_{context}[]
* xref:add-log-connection_{context}[]
* xref:create-replacement-log-connection_{context}[]
