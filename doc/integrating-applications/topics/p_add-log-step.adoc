= Adding a log step to an integration

For each message that an integration receives, a log step can provide
one or more of the following:

* The message's header, which provides metadata about the message.
* The message's body, which provides the content of the message.
* Text that you specify either explicitly or through evaluation of an 
http://camel.apache.org/simple.html[Apache Camel Simple language] expression. 

.Prerequisites
* You have chosen to add a log step rather than a log connection to an
integration. 
* You are creating or editing a flow and {prodname} is prompting you
to choose a step. Or, {prodname} is prompting you to choose a finish connection. 

.Procedure

. In the visualization panel on the left, click the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign]
at the location where you want to add a log step.
. Click *Log*.
. On the *Configure Log Step* page, select the content that you want
to log. If you select *Custom text*, then in the text input field, 
enter one of the following:
* The text that you want to log
* A Camel Simple language expression

+
If you enter an expression, {prodname} resolves the 
expression and logs the resulting text. 
. When log step configuration is complete, click *Done* to add the step
to the flow. 
. When the flow is complete, publish the integration to start seeing output
from the new log step.

.Additional resources
After a flow that has a log step has been executed, output from
the log step appears in the integration's *Activity* tab. See
xref:viewing-integration-activity-information_monitor[Viewing integration activity information].
