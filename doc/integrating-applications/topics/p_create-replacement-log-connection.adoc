= Creating a replacement log connection

{prodname} provides a log connection that you can add to a flow to
log information about each message that an integration processes. If you 
inadvertently delete the provided log connection, then you can create a 
new log connection from the *Log* connector that {prodname} provides.  

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Connections*. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection*.
. Click the *Log* connector. 
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter
a name for the connection, for example, enter `*Log*`.
. Optionally, enter a description for this connection if you need to 
distinguish it. 
. In the upper right, click *Create*. This displays the available 
connections and you can see your new log connection.
