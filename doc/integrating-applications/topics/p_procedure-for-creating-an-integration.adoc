= Procedure for creating a simple integration

{prodname} guides you through the procedure for creating a simple integration. 
It prompts you to choose the start connection, the finish connection, 
optional middle connections, and other steps. When your integration is
complete, you can publish it so that it is running or you can save
it for publication at a later time. 

To learn about the procedure for creating an API provider integration, see 
xref:create-api-provider-integration_api-provider[].

.Prerequisites
* You have a plan for what the steps in the integration will be.
* You created a connection to each application or service that you 
want to connect to in this integration. 

.Procedure

. In the left panel in {prodname}, click *Integrations*.

. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*.

. Choose and configure the start connection:

.. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the connection that you want
to use to start the integration. When this integration is running,
{prodname} will connect to this application and obtain data that you want
the integration to operate on.

.. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the action you want this connection
to perform. The available actions vary for each connection.

.. On the page for configuring the action, enter values in the fields.
.. Optionally, if the connection requires data type specification, 
{prodname} prompts you to click
*Next* to specify the input and/or output type of the action. 
.. Click *Done* to add the start connection.

+
As an alternative to connecting to an application, a start connection can
be a timer that triggers integration execution at intervals that you specify
or it can be a webhook that accepts HTTP requests. 

. Choose and configure the finish connection:

.. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click the connection you want
to use to complete the integration. When this integration is running,
{prodname} will connect to this application with the data that the integration
has been operating on.

.. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the action you want this connection
to perform. The available actions vary for each connection.

.. On the page for configuring the action, enter values in the fields.
.. Optionally, if the connection requires data type specification, 
{prodname} prompts you to click
*Next* to specify the input and/or output type of the action. 
.. Click *Next* to add the finish connection.

+
As an alternative to connecting to an application, a finish connection can
send information to the integration's log about the messages that the
integration processed. To do this, select *Log* when {prodname} prompts
you to choose the finish connection. 

. Optionally, add one or more connections between the start connection and
the finish connection. For each connection, choose its action and enter
any required configuration details.

. Optionally, add one or more steps that operate on integration
data between connections. See
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#about-adding-steps_create[About adding steps between connections].

. In the flow visualization panel on the left, look for any
image:shared/images/WarningIcon.png[Warning] icons. These 
warnings indicate that a data mapper step is needed before 
this connection. Add the required data mapper steps. 

. When the integration contains all needed steps,
click *Save* or *Publish* according to whether you want
to start running the integration.

. In the *Integration Name* field, enter a name that distinguishes this
integration from any other integrations.

. In the *Description* field, enter a description, for example, you can
indicate what this integration does.

. If you are ready to start running the integration, in the upper right,
click *Publish*. Otherwise, click *Save*.

.Results
In the {prodname} *Integrations* page, you can see your new integration
in the list of integrations. If you published the integration, then you
can see that {prodname} is in the process of publishing it. It may take 
a few moments for the status of the integration to become *Running*. 
If you saved the integration, then
*Stopped* appears on the integration's entry.

Click the integration's entry to see a summary of the integration, 
including its version history, logs for any executions, and aggregate
execution metrics.
